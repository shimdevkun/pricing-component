# Pricing Component

This is my personal solution for the pricing-component challenge by Frontend Mentor.

See the live version [here](https://pricing-component.sshimabuku.now.sh/ 'pricing-component')

### Note

This project was made with HTML and CSS only since I wanted to accomplish the bonus as well.
